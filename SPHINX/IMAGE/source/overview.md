NEEDS MORE INFORMATION.

The appOrbit Platform provides efficiency and velocity for application
and infrastructure.

The appOrbit Platform allows you to:

-   **Model and scale out multi-tier applications**. Build multi-tier,
    > distributed applications with support for application clustering
    > and scale out.

-   **Define and deploy applications**. Define your application tiers,
    > services and resources, and expose the service endpoints using
    > the blueprint. Deploy the application on any clusters with
    > any cloud.

-   **Enable application Dev-Test collaboration**. Snapshot an entire
    > application environment including persistent tiers, such as
    > databases and queues, and share them with team members. You can
    > also clone an entire application environment in another cloud.

-   **Deliver cloud and application governance**. Control access to
    > cloud resource pools, Docker repositories, application templates
    > and enforce resource pools.
