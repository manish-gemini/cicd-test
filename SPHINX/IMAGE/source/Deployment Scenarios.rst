**Deployment Scenarios**
========================

The common deployment scenarios for the appOrbit Platform include:

-   All in public network

-   All in private network

-   Mixed mode deployment

**Note**: The All in Public and All in Private scenarios both use the
same installation procedure.

Each of the deployment scenarios are described below.

**All in Public Network**
-------------------------

For the All in Public Network scenario (the default), all of the virtual
machines you created are deployed in the public network. In addition,
you can either deploy a separate, hosted appOrbit Chef, or deploy the
appOrbit Chef in the same host machine as appOrbit Platform.

--------------------------

For the All in Private Network scenario, all of the virtual machines you
created are deployed in the private network. In addition, you deploy the
appOrbit Chef in the same host machine as appOrbit Platform.

network. The appOrbit Chef need to be deployed to an external host in
the public network.
